The NDC is not an entity, or DAO, it is a framework for self-governance.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the NDC is on a journey to create a governance model that allows it to serve the needs of the community. As a result, governance will go through a number of iterations as the project grows, and the needs of the ecosystem change.",
