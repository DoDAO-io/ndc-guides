The NDC wants to help everyone have a voice, and for those voices to be recorded on chain.   \nHow does it do that? \n\nThe NDC is helping develop a system of governance. Once in place, it will allow people to vote on a wide variety of issues, elect members to different governing councils, and even make amendments to the constitution itself.\n\nThe essence of the NDC brings this radical framework to life, and allows the community to then engage and take part in actively shaping the future of NEAR.",

In 2022, members of the blockchain community experienced first hand what happens when centralized authorities abuse their power.\n\nMembers of the NEAR Community believe that the goal of decentralization is to improve on what came before. It believes that increasing transparency and democracy creates a fair and more equal community for everyone.\n\nBut to get there requires a commitment to a process. A process that will need to evolve and adapt to the needs of the community, and for that community to take part in shaping it.\n\nDecentralization is vital for the long term health and sustainability of any collection of people and ideas. The NDC is how the NEAR community is trying to achieve that.",
