That’s a lot of people. The NDC was established to help all those involved take an active role in how NEAR evolves. \n\nWhether that’s how funding is allocated, how elections take place, or who represents the mosaic of interests that make up this thriving and diverse ecosystem. The NDC wants to help everyone have a voice, and for those voices to be recorded on chain.   \nHow does it do that? \n\nThe NDC is helping develop a system of governance. Once in place, it will allow people to vote on a wide variety of issues, elect members to different governing councils, and even make amendments to the constitution itself.\n\nThe essence of the NDC brings this radical framework to life, and allows the community to then engage and take part in actively shaping the future of NEAR. \n\nIn its current stage, the NDC is working on a governance structure that includes the following sections: \n\n1. \tVoting Body - This is every active near account, as qualified by the governance framework\n2.  House of Merit - A group of experienced community members appointed by members of the ecosystem to represent them during votes and key decisions. \n3. Council of Advisors - Advisors appointed to help shape the direction of the House of Merit.\nTransparency Commission - members of the community appointed to ensure checks and balances, are in place and upheld. \n4. Community Treasury - Members of the House of Merit with support from the Council of Advisors help facilitate voting on how community funds are allocated. \n\nYou can find more information on the above \n[here.](https://gov.near.org/t/near-constitution-v1-feedback-requested/30729)\n\nThis is a work in progress, and is currently overseen by the [Governance Working Group (GWG)](https://thewiki.near.page/gwg). This is a collection of community members working on refining the models of governance that will help everyone have their say.  \n\nThe Collective and the GWG invites anyone to share and discuss ideas. \n"

      ### What is the scope of the NDC? 


      While the constitution and governance models are key, the NDC will also
      help to shape, define and deliver the following: 


      1. NEAR Constitution. 

      2. Create and deploy Local and global on-chain decision-making. 

      3. Create and deploy a repository of local and global on-chain journals,
      logs, and minutes. 

      4. Establish governing bodies, their operations, powers, and what checks
      and balances each one needs.

      5. Create and maintain a community treasury with a complete set of
      operating procedures and safeguards.  

      6. Create and maintain Community Guidelines, Code of Conduct, and Dispute
      Resolution protocols. 

      7. Create and deploy a communications strategy to ensure the work carried
      out by the NDC and GWG is easy to access. 

      8. A strategy to help the community find, access and use the NDC. 

      9. Help develop and deploy a DAO Governance Model

      10. Facilitate growth of the NEAR ecosystem more broadly.


      ### What role does the NEAR Foundation play in the NDC? 


      The Foundation is a partner and contributor to the NDC. It supports the
      work being carried out by the Collective, and will ultimately look to hand
      over its funding role to the community once it is ready to do so. 


      ### Who is working on NEAR Digital Collective? 


      The Collective is made up for members of the NEAR ecosystem. Some are
      former members of the Foundation, others are founders of projects, and
      others still are long term users and supporters of the blockchain and the
      projects that are built on it.
