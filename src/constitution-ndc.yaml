      The NEAR Digital Collective (NDC) is an ambitious project that brings
      together users, projects, stakeholders, and partners of the NEAR ecosystem
      to create a radically new way of governing itself. The NDC is not an
      entity, or DAO, it is a framework for self-governance.


      To achieve this goal, the NDC is on a journey to create a governance model
      that allows it to serve the needs of the community. As a result,
      governance will go through a number of iterations as the project grows,
      and the needs of the ecosystem change.

      The foundation of this governance is the NDC Constitution. A constitution
      is, at its simplest, a collection of fundamental principles that an
      organisation or entity agrees to work by. Think of it as a rule book, and
      in that rule book are descriptions of the main institutions that make up
      this organisation, and the relationship between them. 


      Below we’re going to explore one of the first drafts of the NDC
      Constitution. 


      At present, this isn’t fixed in stone, but shows the direction the NDC
      hopes to travel in once the constitution is finalised and live.

      The core principles form the cornerstone of the NDC’s commitment to the
      community. The NDC governance you see referenced below is a catch all term
      for the people working to bring the NDC to life. 


      Freedom from Censorship - NDC Governance Shall not infringe upon the
      rights of the individual or collective concerning freedom of speech or
      participation.


      Non-Infringement - NDC Governance shall not infringe upon the interests,
      decisions, and governance choices of dApps, protocols, and creative works
      built and operating within the NEAR Ecosystem.


      Non-Partiality - NDC Governance Shall not display unfair advantage,
      preferential treatment, undue influence, or partiality to any specific
      project, entity or group (“nodes”).

      Ecosystem First - NDC Governance Is to prioritise the success of the NEAR
      Ecosystem above any individual’s interest. The NEAR Ecosystem is a
      collective and as such, it is always treated as more important than any
      one person, regardless of their influence.


      Declaration of Conflict of Interest - Any individual or member
      participating in the NDC Governance Of the NDC is to disclose relevant
      conflicts of interest, when announcing their candidacy for a position in a
      governance body, and prior to assuming their position in the governance
      structure.


      Transparent Decision-Making - Transparency is the key to establishing
      trust between all stakeholders, and as such the Governance body commits to
      a collaborative and transparent approach in all governance decisions, so
      as to drive accountability and foster trust.
