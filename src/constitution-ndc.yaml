      The NEAR Digital Collective (NDC) is an ambitious project that brings
      together users, projects, stakeholders, and partners of the NEAR ecosystem
      to create a radically new way of governing itself. The NDC is not an
      entity, or DAO, it is a framework for self-governance.


      To achieve this goal, the NDC is on a journey to create a governance model
      that allows it to serve the needs of the community. As a result,
      governance will go through a number of iterations as the project grows,
      and the needs of the ecosystem change.

      The foundation of this governance is the NDC Constitution. A constitution
      is, at its simplest, a collection of fundamental principles that an
      organisation or entity agrees to work by. Think of it as a rule book, and
      in that rule book are descriptions of the main institutions that make up
      this organisation, and the relationship between them. 


      Below we’re going to explore one of the first drafts of the NDC
      Constitution. 


      At present, this isn’t fixed in stone, but shows the direction the NDC
      hopes to travel in once the constitution is finalised and live.
